                If I were placed in the cockpit of a modern jet airliner, my inability to perform well would neither surprise nor bother me. But why should I have trouble with doors and light switches, water faucets and stoves? “Doors?” I can hear the reader saying. 
                “You have trouble opening doors?” Yes. I push doors that are meant to be pulled, pull doors that should be pushed, 
                and walk into doors that neither pull nor push, but slide. Moreover, I see others having the same troubles—unnecessary troubles. 
                My problems with doors have become so well known that confusing doors are often called “Norman doors.” 
                Imagine becoming famous for doors that don’t work right. I’m pretty sure that’s not what my parents planned for me. (Put “Norman doors” into your favorite search engine—be sure to include the quote marks: it makes for fascinating reading.)

        All artificial things are designed. Whether it is the layout of fur- niture in a room, the paths through a garden or forest, or the in- tricacies of an electronic device, some person or group of people had to decide upon the layout, operation, and mechanisms. Not all designed things involve physical structures. Services, 
        lectures, rules and procedures, and the organizational structures of busi- nesses and governments do not have physical mechanisms, but their rules of operation have to be designed, sometimes informally, sometimes precisely recorded and specified.
        But even though people have designed things since prehistoric times, 
        the field of design is relatively new, divided into many areas of specialty. 
        Because everything is designed, the number of areas is enormous, ranging from clothes and furniture to complex control rooms and bridges. 
        This book covers everyday things, focusing on the interplay between technology and people to ensure that the products

        Industrial design: The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer (from the Industrial Design Society of America’s website).
        Interaction design: The focus is upon how people interact with tech- nology. 
        The goal is to enhance people’s understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction de- sign draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience.

           Design is concerned with how things work, how they are con- trolled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology. When done well, the results are brilliant, pleasurable products. When done badly, the products are unusable, leading to great frustration and irritation. Or they might be usable, but force us to behave the way the product wishes rather than as we wish.
           Machines, after all, are conceived, designed, and constructed by people. By human standards, machines are pretty limited. They do not maintain the same kind of rich history of experiences that people have in common with one another, experiences that enable us to interact with others because of this shared understanding. Instead, machines usually follow rather simple, rigid rules of be- havior. 
           If we get the rules wrong even slightly, 
           the machine does what it is told, no matter how insensible and illogical. People are imaginative and creative, filled with common sense; that is, a lot of valuable knowledge built up over years of experience. But instead of capitalizing on these strengths, machines require us to be precise and accurate, 
           things we are not very good at. Machines have no
           The doors in the story illustrate what happens when discoverabil- ity fails. 
           Whether the device is a door or a stove, a mobile phone or a nuclear power plant, the relevant components must be visible, and they must communicate the correct message: What actions are possible? Where and how should they be done? With doors that push, the designer must provide signals that naturally indi- cate where to push. These need not destroy the aesthetics. Put a vertical plate on the side to be pushed.
           Or make the supporting pillars visible. The vertical plate and

            “What are these people doing?” they will wonder. “Why are they doing that?” The prob- lem with the designs of most engineers is that they are too logical. We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be.
            I used to be an engineer, focused upon technical requirements, quite ignorant of people. Even after 
            I switched into psychology and cognitive science, I still maintained my engineering emphasis upon logic and mechanism. 
            It took a long time for me to realize that my understanding of human behavior was relevant to my in- terest in the design of technology. 
            As I watched people struggle with technology, it became clear that the difficulties were caused by the technology, not the people.
            How can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door would seem to be about as simple a device as possible. 
            There is not much you can do to a door: you can open it or shut it. Suppose you are in an office building, walking down a corridor. 
            You come to a door. How does it open? Should you push or pull, on the left or the right? Maybe the door slides.

            I was called upon to help analyze the American nuclear power plant accident at Three Mile Island (the island name comes 
            from the fact that it is located on a river, three miles south of Middle- town in the state of Pennsylvania). 
            In this incident, a rather simple mechanical failure was misdiagnosed. This led to several days of difficulties and confusion, 
            total destruction of the reactor, and a very close call to a severe radiation release, 
            all of which brought the American nuclear power industry to a complete halt. 
            The op- erators were blamed for these failures: “human error” was the im- mediate analysis. 
            But the committee I was on discovered that the plant’s control rooms were so poorly designed that error was inevi- table: 
            design was at fault, not the operators. The moral was simple: we were designing things for people, so we needed to understand both technology and people.
            But that’s a difficult step for many engineers: machines are so logical, so orderly. If we didn’t have people, everything would work so much better. Yup, that’s how I used to think.
            How can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door would seem to be about as simple a device as possible. There is not much you can do to a door: you can open it or shut it. 
            Suppose you are in an office building, walking down a corridor.
            You come to a door. How does it open? Should you push or pull, on the left or the right? Maybe the door slides. 
            If so, in which direction? I have seen doors that slide to the left, to the right, and even up into the ceiling.
